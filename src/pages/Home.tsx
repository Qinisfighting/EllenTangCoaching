                <p className="md:text-xl">I believe that the more people are living a fulfilled life, the better place our world will be. Because when we affirm our authentic selves in the world, we feel less need to cause pain to others and ourselves.</p>
                <p className="md:text-xl">I collaborate with individuals all over the world who are on their paths towards self-discovery, growth, and fulfilment. Together, we will co-create an environment where unconditional acceptance of ourselves is the norm, because it is only then can we clear our clouded visions and explore freely what a fulfilled life looks like for each one of us as unique individuals.</p>
                <p className="md:text-xl">I cannot wait to start this thrilling journey with you.</p>
