        <h3>Types of personal development service available:</h3>

        <h3>Sessions</h3>
        <p>
        Regular times for sessions are agreed at the start of the working engagement and remain yours unless changed by
        mutual agreement. Sessions begin at ten minutes past the hour and end on the hour, giving time for transitions
        between sessions. Sessions end on the hour even if they start late unless that lateness is Ellen’s fault. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- A full session is of 50 minutes duration. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        All sessions can be extended if time is available. When a session is extended the fee is adjusted on a pro rata basis. 
        </p>

        <h3>Emergency calls</h3>
        <p>
        You may telephone or email at times other than your regular hours if you need to. Reasonable time spent on such
        calls will not be charged for. I discourage texting for practical reasons related to immediacy and confidentiality. 
        </p>
        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>
        Fees are payable in full before each session unless otherwise agreed. They may be made in cash, via bank transfer, or
by debit/credit card. 
        </p>
        <h3>Fees (2021): </h3>  
        <ul>
          <li>- Individual sessions: GBP 90.00</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>
        Fees are increased once a year in line with inflation. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cancellation policy</h3>
        <p>
          Sessions may be cancelled or rescheduled by the client without charge provided that a minimum of 24 hours’ notice
        is given. Cancellation or rescheduling within 24 hours or less before a booked session will be charged the full fee. In
        the event of a late cancellation or rescheduling due to “Acts of God” a half fee is payable. 
        </p>
        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
        Anything you say or do during sessions is held in complete confidence and will not be repeated without your explicit
permission. Clients are not bound by such confidentiality and may discuss their work with whom they choose.
Partners form their own agreements regarding the confidentiality of each other’s material. I keep no notes of
sessions. This is for reasons of good practice and to maximise client confidentiality. If you have specific concerns
around confidentiality related perhaps to your social circumstances or the nature of your work, please be sure to
raise them so we can ensure safe working. 
        </p>
        <h3>Online working considerations</h3>
        <p>
        Working online offers a range of opportunities not available when working in person. These include convenience, a
high level of confidentiality and the ability to physically reveal aspects of one’s life that a client might otherwise
prefer to keep concealed. It is the responsibility of the client to ensure that his or her use of online coaching
conforms to the relevant legislation in her or his country. I am highly attentive to the online technology in use, but
technological quality cannot be guaranteed.
